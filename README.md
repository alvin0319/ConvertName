# ConvertName
PocketMine-MP Plugin for converting items & blocks name to your language.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alvin0319/ConvertName/master/assets/example.png)

# Usage
Due to license issue, I don't put the language files directly to this plugin.

You can get your minecraft language file from [here](https://aka.ms/resourcepacktemplate)

```yaml
# When you change this field, you have to replace the language file to correct language
# You can get language file from https://aka.ms/resourcepacktemplate
# File extension should be contained in the file name
language_file: ko_kr.lang
```

Put your language file to the plugin data folder, and edit the `language_file` to your language file name.
